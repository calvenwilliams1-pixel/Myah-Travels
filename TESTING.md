Everything since Wave 2 has been implemented without local testing. Run this on the local PC.

node scripts/setup-db.js
node scripts/migrate-travel-segments-to-legs.js
npm run dev
~~~

## Wave 2 — Multi-leg Travel

- [ ] **2.1** Existing travel segments migrated to legs — Singapore demo AC0020 shows chained leg card
- [ ] **2.2** Multi-leg creation — YYZ → YYC → NRT, verify "4h connection" gap + "+1 day" arrival badge
- [ ] **2.3** Non-flight modes — Train/Bus/Transfer change field labels
- [ ] **2.4** Leg deletion guard — "Delete the segment instead of its last leg"
- [ ] **2.5** Timezone labels — cosmetic only, blank by default
- [ ] **2.6** Reference dropdown still works on segments

## Wave 3 — Ban / Revoke / Unban

- [ ] **3.1** Ban flow — Active badge + Ban button; magic link works pre-ban
- [ ] **3.2** Ban kills access — live session denied, badge goes red
- [ ] **3.3** Unban requires fresh link — old link stays dead, new link works
- [ ] **3.4** Ban exclusion — banned member gets no new email
- [ ] **3.5** Session invalidation — refresh denies after ban

## Wave 4 — Hero Styling + Accent

- [ ] **4.1** Hero size options — Banner/Medium/Large/Full change preview height
- [ ] **4.2** Text overlay — title/subtitle/caption with gradient scrim
- [ ] **4.3** Image upload from PC — returns /uploads/...
- [ ] **4.4** Paste URL tab works
